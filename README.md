JSNotepad
=========

A simple client-side notepad made in JavaScript. Made as a project to show my skills as a programmer to a company, that may consider my internship.

Features
--------

Apart from keeping text, and letting the user edit it, the application also features saving the text file to a local storage, and loading files into the notepad from that storage.

Dark mode, and light mode is implemented - theese re-format the text, and background to suit the user's choice. The default option is dark mode.

The "New file" option opens a new tab containing the notepad when called; both tabs will work independently from eachother.

(Dis)enabling word wrapping - this option allows the user to set the notepad to wrap lines at will.

Line counter, and character counter - theese counters display the current number of characters and lines in a text file. The counters are updated each 0.25s (250ms).
